# Steam Review Editor

Steam Review Editor allows you to easily create and modify your reviews in real-time, without having to manually apply steam's complex markup tags.

---

## Usage

Simply type your review, hit "Copy to Clipboard", and paste it in Steam!

While the markup is automatically applied, there are currently a few elements that may require your modification before publishing your review.

1. Blockquotes by default, have an author value of "author". Modify this to your liking, or omit it completely.

## Resources

* The text editor is [Quill](http://quilljs.com/) and is modified using CSS
* The website is built with [Bootstrap v4.6.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
* The colours, as well as other layout ideas were mostly sourced from Steam's very own website: [Steam Store](http://store.steampowered.com)

## Contributions

All contributions to the project are totally welcome. Anything that can improve the editor, website performance, layout or fix bugs are likely to be merged with the base project.
