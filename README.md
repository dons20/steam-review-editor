# Steam Review Editor

## Introduction

Steam Review Editor is a simple but useful utility to help curators write, format and preview their reviews before they publish them officially. It shows you at a glance, the formatting options that Steam support on their platform, allowing you to be extra creative when writing, instead of trying to memorize complex syntax.

This tool can also be helpful outside of the review section. Anywhere that the Steam markup is allowed, you can use the markup generated by the editor to help to customize your text.

This means you can use it to format some aspects of your profile, guides, and even your Steam workshop descriptions.
